# Camtraps
Gathering place for reproducible camera trap scripts

The standardization script must be run before any of the other scripts. This script requires you to first download your data report from the WildCo website.
The other three scripts can be run after running the standardization script, and don't need to be run in any particular order if used.

These scripts require a moderate understanding of R in order to make them work for you.
